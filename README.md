# Introduction

This repository is a text based Connect Four game using Python. I am just starting this project, so the focus right now is on setting up the basic structure, understanding the game rules, and implementing the basic gameplay.

# Current Goal

The goal is to create a intermediate version of Connect Four that allows two players to play the game by taking turns.

# First Steps in the Project

Since this is my starting point, these are the simple steps I am currently doing:

# 1. Understanding the game rules

* The game is played on a 6×7 grid (6 rows, 7 columns).

* Two players take turns dropping pieces into columns.

* The first player to connect four pieces in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally wins.

# 2. Setting up the project

* Created a new folder for the project.
  
* Added a starter Python file named game.py.

# 3. Planning the basic code structure

* Created an empty game board using lists.

* Wrote a function to print the board in the terminal.

* Wrote a function to drop a piece into a column.

* Implemented win detection for horizontal and vertical.

  Added basic correctness checking:

* Validating player input.

* Preventing placing a piece in a full column.

* Checking the board after each move for a win.

# 4. Advanced Features (Future Plans)

Once the basic game is working, I may try to add some advanced features in the future:

* Improved game logic – for example, adding extra checks to make the game more robust.

* Better user interface – maybe a graphical version instead of just text in the terminal.

* Python optimisation techniques – I could try optimising the code to make it faster or use less memory.

For now, I am focusing only on the basic text-based game. These features will be added later as I learn more and improve the project.
