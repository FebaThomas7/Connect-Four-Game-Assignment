# Connect Four Game –(Python)

# Introduction

This repository is for the very beginning of building a simple, text-based Connect Four game using Python. I am just starting this project, so the focus right now is on setting up the basic structure and understanding how the game will work.

# Current Goal

The goal is to create a basic version of Connect Four game that runs in the terminal.

# First Steps in the Project

Since this is my starting point, these are the simple steps I am currently doing:

# 1. Understanding the game rules

* The game is played on a 7×6 grid.
* Two players take turns dropping pieces into columns.
* The first player to connect four pieces in a row wins.

# 2. Setting up the project

* Created a new folder for the project.
* Added a starter Python file named game.py.

# 3. Planning the basic code structure

* I will begin by creating an empty game board using lists.
* I will write a basic function to print the board in the terminal.

# 4. Advanced Features (Future Plans)
Once the basic game is working, I may try to add some advanced features in the future:

* Improved game logic – for example, adding extra checks to make the game more robust.

* Better user interface – maybe a graphical version instead of just text in the terminal.

* Python optimisation techniques – I could try optimising the code to make it faster or use less memory.

For now, I am focusing only on the basic text-based game. These features will be added later as I learn more and improve the project.

# why my README is simple

I am still at the very beginning of the project, so this README reflects only the starting stage. I will update it later when I add more features and game logic.
